# ***Phase 1***
In this phase all of the tokens will be dumped into `tokens.txt` file in `bin` directory.

## ***Running***
Just run `Phase1.sh` and check `tokens.txt` in bin directory.

```
$ sh Phase1.sh 
```
It will use predefined sample named `sample`.

## ***Customized input***
If you want to run your own sample, you can simply edit `sample` file or pass path to your sample, absolute or relative ro bash script path, while running `Phase1.sh`:

```
$ sh Phase1.sh -s <path_to_sample>
```
